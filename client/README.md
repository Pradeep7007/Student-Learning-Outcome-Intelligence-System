## 📊 Example Use Case

* 100 students enrolled in a programming course
* System detects:

  * 40% struggling with recursion
  * Students missing labs are 3× more likely to fail
* Teacher receives recommendation:

  > “Schedule extra practice session for recursion outcome.”

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Improve student success rate
* Enable data-driven teaching
* Identify struggling students early
* Enhance curriculum effectiveness

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Real-time LMS integration
* Advanced deep learning models
* Automated feedback generation
* Student mobile application
* Cloud deployment (AWS / Azure)
